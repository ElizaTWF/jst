# Build a dev env - node modules {Node, NPM, Jest} #

The plan:
	->Build a small feature - a maths app

			-> Build a test file using matchers running positive tests

					-> Build a test file using matchers running negative tests

						->Enhance your environment for editing and version control

							->Sync to git

								->Edit in Visual Studio
                
## Install your runtime environment ##               
You can install Node from this link. 

This will launch a Windows MSI installer to place the application on your PC. 

Accept all the installer defaults. 

If you have applications like Visual Studio installed, you may be asked if you want to integrate with it. This is not necessary for this tutorial.
